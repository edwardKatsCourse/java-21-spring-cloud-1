Configurable server environment!

Create 4 servers:
- gateway-service
- account-service-backup
- account-service-production
- config-server

Roles:
GATEWAY - receives requests and sends them to ACCOUNT-SERVICE (which one herein under).
ACCOUNT-SERVICE-BACKUP - receives the data from gateway and stores the data as json files
in the file system.
ACCOUNT-SERVICE-PRODUCTION - receives requests from GATEWAY when CONFIG-SERVER is up and stores
the data to the database.
CONFIG-SERVER - contains configurations for all servers.

Flow:
Create exact same Person classes with any set of fields in ACCOUNT-SERVICE-BACKUP and ACCOUNT-SERVICE-PRODUCTION.

GATEWAY - is the entry point of the application. It receives the requests (from Postman) and redirects them
to ACCOUNT-SERVICE-BACKUP by default using RestTemplate.
URL of ACCOUNT-SERVICE-BACKUP should be configured in application.properties file of GATEWAY as "account.service.path".

ACCOUNT-SERVICE-BACKUP stores the data to the file system. Each new request is a new file
(use timestamp or increment filename by one for every new file).
There is an option of using H2 for that purpose instead of file system, but it is necessary to configure datasource.url
for it to save the data to file (instead of using in-memory saving). Search in Google how to do that. Almost the same
as MySQL or any other SQL database.

CONFIG-SERVER contains gateway.properties for GATEWAY. In gateway.properties in "account.service.path" should be
specified a path to ACCOUNT-SERVICE-PRODUCTION.
Also contains MySQL properties for ACCOUNT-SERVICE-PRODUCTION.
Notice: ACCOUNT-SERVICE-PRODUCTION must not participate in the process, if CONFIG-SERVER is down!

ACCOUNT-SERVICE-PRODUCTION receives the requests in the same way as ACCOUNT-SERVICE-BACKUP does, but stores the info
to MySQL or MongoDB database (on your choice).
Connection properties of the database should be specified in CONFIG-SERVER in  account-service-production.properties

Expectations:
If CONFIG-SERVER is down - GATEWAY should send the requests to ACCOUNT-SERVICE-BACKUP. When CONFIG-SERVER is up,
GATEWAY should fetch ACCOUNT-SERVICE-PRODUCTION path ("account.service.path" will be overriden by CONFIG-SERVER)
and send the requests to ACCOUNT-SERVICE-PRODUCTION instead.

Spring Data Rest (Rest Repositories) is required for ACCOUNT-SERVICE-PRODUCTION and is recommended for ACCOUNT-SERVICE-BACKUP.

Good luck!
